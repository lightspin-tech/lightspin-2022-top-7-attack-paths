# Exploitable public workload leading to privilege escalation

This attack path details the ability of an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in a public workload and gain initial footholds into the cloud environment. The vulnerability can be either a well-known one or a zero-day. In both cases, if not mitigated, this kind of initial access into the cloud environment can increase the risk of the attack vector. One of the more common implications of this kind of attack method is leveraging this into privilege escalation within the cloud environment.
